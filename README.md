# Hello, ðŸ‘‹ my name is Vitaliy, frontend developer from Ukraine
## I am probably the oldest who came to this sphere - 52 years old. Life forced me, I lost everything twice because of the war, now there is no job, no housing, no health. But I'm very interested, it distracts me from the war, health problems and all the negativity. This is probably the kind of work that is like a hobby, but money is also paid for it! Therefore, please support me, for 50 life is just beginning!
I have been connected with computers since 1998, I know what MS DOS and NORTON, WIN 97 are, but as an administrator. Now it's a Frontend developer.

- ðŸ”­   I am currently working on a project to sell and rent website
- ðŸŒ± I am currently learning programming languages.
- ðŸ‘¯ I am looking for cooperation with everyone who is interested in developing websites based on new technologies
